## Contents
- data: This directory contains the dataset used in the analysis.
- code: This directory contains the Python code implementing the model.
- reading materials: This directory contains relevant reading inspirational to this project and more information about the data insights.

## Methodology
We employ ridge regression as our modeling approach due to its ability to handle multicollinearity and provide robust estimates of feature coefficients. By leveraging OOP, we develop a modular and extensible codebase that allows for easy experimentation and interpretation of results.

## Dependencies
The code in this repository is written in Python. Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- numpy
